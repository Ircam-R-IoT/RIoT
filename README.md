- The main firmware repository maintained by IRCAM is now located at [github.com/Ircam-R-IoT/firmware](https://github.com/Ircam-R-IoT/firmware), and the official firmware repository maintained by BITalino is located at [github.com/BITalinoWorld/firmware-bitalino-riot](https://github.com/BITalinoWorld/firmware-bitalino-riot)
- The Max abstractions present in this repository are now part of the MuBu release and require the firmware v1.8 or higher
